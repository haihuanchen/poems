<h1>Desiderata</h1>
<h3>BY Max Ehrmann</h3>

Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,<br/>
and remember what peace there may be in silence.<br/>
As far as possible,<br/>
without surrender,<br/> 
be on good terms with all persons.<br/><br/>

Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br/>
and listen to others, <br/>
even to the dull and the ignorant; <br/>
they too have their story.<br/><br/>

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; <br/>
they are vexations to the spirit. <br/>
If you compare yourself with others, <br/>
you may become vain or bitter, <br/>
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br/><br/>

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. <br/>
Keep interested in your own career, <br/>
however humble; <br/>
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br/><br/>

Exercise caution in your business affairs,<br/> 
for the world is full of trickery. <br/>
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; <br/>
many persons strive for high ideals,<br/> 
and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br/><br/>

Be yourself. <br/>
Especially do not feign affection. <br/>
Neither be cynical about love; <br/>
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, <br/>
it is as perennial as the grass.<br/><br/>

Take kindly the counsel of the years, <br/>
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br/>
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. <br/>
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. <br/>
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br/><br/>

Beyond a wholesome discipline, <br/>
be gentle with yourself. <br/>
You are a child of the universe, <br/>
no less than the trees and the stars; <br/>
you have a right to be here.<br/><br/>

And whether or not it is clear to you, <br/>
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br/>
Therefore be at peace with God, <br/>
whatever you conceive Him to be. <br/>
And whatever your labors and aspirations, <br/>
in the noisy confusion of life,<br/> 
keep peace in your soul. <br/><br/>

With all its sham, <br/>
drudgery and broken dreams, <br/>
it is still a beautiful world. <br/>
Be cheerful. <br/>
Strive to be happy.<br/><br/>
