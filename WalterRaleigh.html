<h1>What is This Life</h1>
<h3>BY Walter Raleigh</h3>

What is our life? A play of passion;<br/>
Our mirth the music of division;<br/>
Our mothers’ wombs the tiring-houses be,<br/>
Where we are dressed for this short comedy.<br/>
Heaven the judicious sharp spectator is,<br/>
That sits and marks still who doth act amiss;<br/>
Our graves that hide us from the searching sun<br/>
Are like drawn curtains when the play is done.<br/>
Thus march we, playing, to our latest rest,<br/>
Only we die in earnest – that’s no jest.<br/>
