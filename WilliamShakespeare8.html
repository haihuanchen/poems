<h1>Sonnet 27</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br/>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br/>
But then begins a journey in my head,<br/>
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:<br/>
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)<br/>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br/>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br/>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br/>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<br/>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br/>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<br/>
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.<br/>
   Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br/>
   For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.<br/>
