<h1>Sonnet 73</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

That time of year thou mayst in me behold<br/>
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br/>
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br/>
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<br/>
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day<br/>
As after sunset fadeth in the west,<br/>
Which by and by black night doth take away,<br/>
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.<br/>
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire<br/>
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,<br/>
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,<br/>
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.<br/>
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,<br/>
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.<br/>
