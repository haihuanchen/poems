<h1>Crossing Brooklyn Ferry</h1>
<h3>BY Walt Whitman</h3>

Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face! <br/>
Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face. <br/><br/>

Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me! <br/>
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose, <br/>
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose. <br/><br/>

The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day, <br/>
The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, <br/>
The similitudes of the past and those of the future, <br/>
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, <br/>
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, <br/>
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, <br/>
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others. <br/><br/>

Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore, <br/>
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide, <br/>
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east, <br/>
Others will see the islands large and small; <br/>
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, <br/>
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, <br/>
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide. <br/><br/>
