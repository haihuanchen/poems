<h1>Invictus</h1>
<h3>BY William Ernest Henley</h3>

Out of the night that covers me,   <br/>
  Black as the Pit from pole to pole,  <br/> 
I thank whatever gods may be   <br/>
  For my unconquerable soul.   <br/><br/>

In the fell clutch of circumstance <br/>
  I have not winced nor cried aloud.  <br/> 
Under the bludgeonings of chance   <br/>
  My head is bloody, but unbowed.   <br/><br/>

Beyond this place of wrath and tears  <br/> 
  Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br/>
And yet the menace of the years   <br/>
  Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.  <br/> <br/>

It matters not how strait the gate,   <br/>
  How charged with punishments the scroll,  <br/> 
I am the master of my fate:<br/>
  I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/>
