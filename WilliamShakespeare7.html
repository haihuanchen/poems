<h1>Sonnet 116</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br/>
Admit impediments. Love is not love<br/>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br/>
Or bends with the remover to remove.<br/>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br/>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br/>
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,<br/>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br/>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br/>
Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br/>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br/>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br/>
If this be error and upon me prov'd,<br/>
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.<br/>
