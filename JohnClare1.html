<h1>I Am!</h1>
<h3>BY John Clare</h3>

I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;<br/>
My friends forsake me like a memory lost:<br/>
I am the self-consumer of my woes—<br/>
They rise and vanish in oblivious host,<br/>
Like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes<br/>
And yet I am, and live—like vapours tossed<br/><br/>

Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,<br/>
Into the living sea of waking dreams,<br/>
Where there is neither sense of life or joys,<br/>
But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems;<br/>
Even the dearest that I loved the best<br/>
Are strange—nay, rather, stranger than the rest.<br/><br/>

I long for scenes where man hath never trod<br/>
A place where woman never smiled or wept<br/>
There to abide with my Creator, God,<br/>
And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept,<br/>
Untroubling and untroubled where I lie<br/>
The grass below—above the vaulted sky.<br/><br/>
