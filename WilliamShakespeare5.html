<h1>Sonnet 30</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought<br/>
I summon up remembrance of things past,<br/>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br/>
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<br/>
Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,<br/>
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<br/>
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,<br/>
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;<br/>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br/>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<br/>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br/>
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br/>
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<br/>
All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.<br/>
