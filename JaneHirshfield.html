<h1>My Life Was The Size Of My Life</h1>
<h3>BY Jane Hirshfield</h3>

My life was the size of my life.<br/>
Its rooms were room-sized,<br/>
its soul was the size of a soul.<br/>
In its background, mitochondria hummed,<br/>
above it sun, clouds, snow,<br/>
the transit of stars and planets.<br/>
It rode elevators, bullet trains,<br/>
various airplanes, a donkey.<br/>
It wore socks, shirts, its own ears and nose.<br/>
It ate, it slept, it opened<br/>
and closed its hands, its windows.<br/>
Others, I know, had lives larger.<br/>
Others, I know, had lives shorter.<br/>
The depth of lives, too, is different.<br/>
There were times my life and I made jokes together.<br/>
There were times we made bread.<br/>
Once, I grew moody and distant.<br/>
I told my life I would like some time,<br/>
I would like to try seeing others.<br/>
In a week, my empty suitcase and I returned.<br/>
I was hungry, then, and my life,<br/>
my life, too, was hungry, we could not keep<br/>
our hands off<br/>       
our clothes on<br/>   
our tongues from<br/>
