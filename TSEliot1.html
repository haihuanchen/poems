<h1>Morning at the Window</h1>
<h3>BY T.S. Eliot</h3>

They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,<br/>
And along the trampled edges of the street<br/>
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids<br/>
Sprouting despondently at area gates.<br/><br/>

The brown waves of fog toss up to me<br/>
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,<br/>
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts<br/>
An aimless smile that hovers in the air<br/>
And vanishes along the level of the roofs.<br/><br/>
