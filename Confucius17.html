<h1>Gaining Wisdom</h1>
<h3>BY Confucius</h3>

There are three methods to gaining wisdom. <br/>
The first is reflection, which is the highest. <br/>
The second is limitation, which is the easiest. <br/>
The third is experience, which is the bitterest.<br/>
生而知之者上也,学而知之者次也,困而学之,又其次也.困而不学,民斯为下矣. <br/>
