<h1>Sunset</h1>
<h3>BY E. E. Cummings</h3>

Great carnal mountains crouching in the cloud <br/>
That marrieth the young earth with a ring, <br/>
Yet still its thoughts builds heavenward, whence spring <br/>
Wee villages of vapor, sunset-proud.— <br/>
And to the meanest door hastes one pure-browed <br/>
White-fingered star, a little, childish thing, <br/>
The busy needle of her light to bring, <br/>
And stitch, and stitch, upon the dead day’s shroud. <br/>
Poises the sun upon his west, a spark <br/>
Superlative,—and dives beneath the world; <br/>
From the day’s fillets Night shakes out her locks; <br/>
List! One pure trembling drop of cadence purled— <br/>
“Summer!”—a meek thrush whispers to the dark. <br/>
Hark! the cold ripple sneering on the rocks! <br/>
