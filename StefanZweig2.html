<h1>Chess Story</h1>
<h3>BY Stefan Zweig</h3>

For the more a man limits himself, <br/>
the nearer he is on the other hand to what is limitless; <br/>
it is precisely those who are apparently aloof from the world <br/>
who build for themselves a remarkable and thoroughly individual world in miniature, <br/>
using their own special equipment, <br/>
termit-like.<br/>
