<h1>The Way through the Woods</h1>
<h3>BY Rudyard Kipling</h3>

THEY shut the road through the woods<br/>
Seventy years ago.<br/>
Weather and rain have undone it again,<br/>
And now you would never know<br/>
There was once a road through the woods<br/>
Before they planted the trees.<br/>
It is underneath the coppice and heath,<br/>
And the thin anemones.<br/>
Only the keeper sees<br/>
That, where the ring-dove broods,<br/>
And the badgers roll at ease,<br/>
There was once a road through the woods.<br/>
Yet, if you enter the woods<br/>
Of a summer evening late,<br/>
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools<br/>
Where the otter whistles his mate,<br/>
(They fear not men in the woods,<br/>
Because they see so few.)<br/>
You will hear the beat of a horse's feet,<br/>
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,<br/>
Steadily cantering through<br/>
The misty solitudes,<br/>
As though they perfectly knew<br/>
The old lost road through the woods.<br/>
But there is no road through the woods.<br/>
