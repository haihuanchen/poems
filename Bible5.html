<h1>Book of Ecclesiastes 3:1</h1>
<h3>BY Old Testament</h3>

To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:<br/>
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br/>
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br/>
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;<br/>
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br/>
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;<br/>
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br/>
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.<br/>
