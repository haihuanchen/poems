<h1>The Post Office Girl</h1>
<h3>BY Stefan Zweig</h3>

Time to leave now,<br/>
get out of this room,<br/>
go somewhere, anywhere;<br/>
sharpen this feeling of happiness and freedom,<br/>
stretch your limbs,<br/>
fill your eyes,<br/>
be awake,<br/>
wider awake,<br/>
vividly awake in every sense and every pore.<br/>
