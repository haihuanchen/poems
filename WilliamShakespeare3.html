<h1>Julius Caesar</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>


Marullus speaks to two rejoicing Commoners <br/>
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home? <br/>
What tributaries follow him to Rome, <br/>
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels? <br/>
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things! <br/>
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, <br/>
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft <br/>
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements, <br/>
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops, <br/>
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat <br/>
The livelong day, with patient expectation, <br/>
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome: <br/>
And when you saw his chariot but appear, <br/>
Have you not made an universal shout, <br/>
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks, <br/>
To hear the replication of your sounds <br/>
Made in her concave shores? <br/>
And do you now put on your best attire? <br/>
And do you now cull out a holiday? <br/>
And do you now strew flowers in his way <br/>
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone! <br/>
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, <br/>
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague <br/>
That needs must light on this ingratitude. <br/>
