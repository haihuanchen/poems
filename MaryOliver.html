<h1>To Live</h1>
<h3>BY Mary Oliver</h3>

to live  <br/>
in this world <br/><br/>

you must be able <br/>
to do three things <br/>
to love what is mortal; <br/>
to hold it <br/><br/>

against your bones knowing <br/>
your own life depends on it; <br/>
and, when the time comes to let it go, <br/>
to let it go <br/><br/>
