<h1>To Summer</h1>
<h3>BY William Blake</h3>

O Thou who passest thro’ our vallies in <br/>
Thy strength, curb thy fierce steeds, allay the heat <br/>
That flames from their large nostrils! thou, O Summer, <br/>
Oft pitched’st here thy golden tent, and oft <br/>
Beneath our oaks hast slept, while we beheld <br/>
With joy, thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair. <br/><br/>

Beneath our thickest shades we oft have heard <br/>
Thy voice, when noon upon his fervid car <br/>
Rode o’er the deep of heaven; beside our springs <br/>
Sit down, and in our mossy vallies, on <br/>
Some bank beside a river clear, throw thy <br/>
Silk draperies off, and rush into the stream: <br/>
Our vallies love the Summer in his pride. <br/><br/>

Our bards are fam’d who strike the silver wire: <br/>
Our youth are bolder than the southern swains: <br/>
Our maidens fairer in the sprightly dance: <br/>
We lack not songs, nor instruments of joy, <br/>
Nor echoes sweet, nor waters clear as heaven, <br/>
Nor laurel wreaths against the sultry heat. <br/><br/>
