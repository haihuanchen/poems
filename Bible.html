<h1>Corinthians 10:13</h1>
<h3>BY New Testament</h3>

There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: <br/>
but God is faithful, <br/>
who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; <br/>
but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, <br/>
that ye may be able to bear it.<br/>
