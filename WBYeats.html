<h1>The Young Man's Song</h1>
<h3>BY William Butcher Yeats</h3>

I whispered, "I am too young,"  <br/>
And then, "I am old enough";   <br/>
Wherefore I threw a penny   <br/>
To find out if I might love.   <br/>
"Go and love, go and love, young man,<br/>
If the lady be young and fair,"   <br/>
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,   <br/>
I am looped in the loops of her hair.   <br/><br/>
   
Oh, love is the crooked thing,   <br/>
There is nobody wise enough<br/>
To find out all that is in it,   <br/>
For he would be thinking of love  <br/> 
Till the stars had run away,   <br/>
And the shadows eaten the moon.   <br/>
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,<br/>
One cannot begin it too soon. <br/><br/>
