<h1>Mutability</h1>
<h3>BY Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
 
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; <br/>
  How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver, <br/>
Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon <br/>
  Night closes round, and they are lost for ever: <br/><br/>

Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings <br/>
  Give various response to each varying blast, <br/>
To whose frail frame no second motion brings <br/>
  One mood or modulation like the last. <br/><br/>

We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep; <br/>
  We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day; <br/>
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep; <br/>
  Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away: <br/><br/>

It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow, <br/>
  The path of its departure still is free: <br/>
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow; <br/>
  Nought may endure but Mutability. <br/><br/>
