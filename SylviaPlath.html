<h1>Tulips</h1>
<h3>BY Sylvia Plath</h3>

The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. <br/>
Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.  <br/>  
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly <br/>
As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.  <br/>  
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.    <br/>
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses    <br/>
And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons. <br/><br/>

They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff    <br/>
Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. <br/>
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. <br/>
The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, <br/>
They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, <br/>
Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,    <br/>
So it is impossible to tell how many there are. <br/><br/>

My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water <br/>
Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. <br/>
They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.  <br/>  
Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage—— <br/>
My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   <br/> 
My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   <br/> 
Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks. <br/><br/>

I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat   <br/> 
stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. <br/>
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.  <br/>  
Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   <br/> 
I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books    <br/>
Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.  <br/>  
I am a nun now, I have never been so pure. <br/><br/>

I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted <br/>
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. <br/>
How free it is, you have no idea how free—— <br/>
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, <br/>
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. <br/>
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   <br/> 
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   <br/> <br/>

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. <br/>
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe    <br/>
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   <br/> 
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. <br/>
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,  <br/>  
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,    <br/>
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck. <br/><br/>

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.    <br/>
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me <br/>
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,  <br/>  
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow    <br/>
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,    <br/>
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.    <br/>
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen. <br/><br/>

Before they came the air was calm enough, <br/>
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   <br/> 
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. <br/>
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   <br/> 
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.    <br/>
They concentrate my attention, that was happy   <br/> 
Playing and resting without committing itself. <br/><br/>

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. <br/>
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   <br/> 
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,    <br/>
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes <br/>
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. <br/>
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea, <br/>
And comes from a country far away as health. <br/><br/>
