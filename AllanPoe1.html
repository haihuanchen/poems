<h1>Eldorado</h1>
<h3>BY Edgar Allan Poe</h3>

Gaily bedight,<br/>
A gallant knight,<br/>
In sunshine and in shadow,  <br/> 
Had journeyed long,  <br/> 
Singing a song,<br/>
In search of Eldorado.<br/><br/>

But he grew old—<br/>
This knight so bold— <br/>  
And o’er his heart a shadow—<br/>   
Fell as he found<br/>
No spot of ground<br/>
That looked like Eldorado.<br/><br/>

And, as his strength  <br/> 
Failed him at length,<br/>
He met a pilgrim shadow—   <br/>
‘Shadow,’ said he, <br/>  
‘Where can it be—<br/>
This land of Eldorado?’<br/><br/>

‘Over the Mountains<br/>
Of the Moon,<br/>
Down the Valley of the Shadow, <br/>  
Ride, boldly ride,’<br/>
The shade replied,—<br/>
‘If you seek for Eldorado!’<br/><br/>
