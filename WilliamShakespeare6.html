<h1>Sonnet 29</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes, <br/>
I all alone beweep my outcast state, <br/>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, <br/>
And look upon myself and curse my fate, <br/>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, <br/>
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed, <br/>
Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope, <br/>
With what I most enjoy contented least; <br/>
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, <br/>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state, <br/>
(Like to the lark at break of day arising <br/>
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate; <br/>
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings <br/>
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings. <br/>
