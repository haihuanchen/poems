<h1>To Autumn</h1>
<h3>BY William Blake</h3>

O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stained <br/>
With the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit <br/>
Beneath my shady roof; there thou mayst rest, <br/>
And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe, <br/>
And all the daughters of the year shall dance! <br/>
Sing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers. <br/><br/>

"The narrow bud opens her beauties to <br/>
The sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins; <br/>
Blossoms hang round the brows of Morning, and <br/>
Flourish down the bright cheek of modest Eve, <br/>
Till clust'ring Summer breaks forth into singing, <br/>
And feather'd clouds strew flowers round her head. <br/><br/>

"The spirits of the air live on the smells <br/>
Of fruit; and Joy, with pinions light, roves round <br/>
The gardens, or sits singing in the trees." <br/>
Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat; <br/>
Then rose, girded himself, and o'er the bleak <br/>
Hills fled from our sight; but left his golden load. <br/><br/>
