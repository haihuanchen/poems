<h1>To Think of Time</h1>
<h3>BY Walt Whitman</h3>

To think of timeâ€”of all that retrospection!  <br/> 
To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!   <br/><br/>
   
Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?   <br/>
Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?   <br/>
Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?<br/><br/>
   
Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?   <br/>
If the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.   <br/><br/>
   
To think that the sun rose in the east! <br/>
that men and women <br/>were flexible, real, alive! that everything was alive!   <br/>
To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part!   <br/>
To think that we are now here, and bear our part!<br/><br/>
