<h1>A Dream</h1>
<h3>BY Edgar Allan Poe</h3>

In visions of the dark night <br/>
I have dreamed of joy departed— <br/>
But a waking dream of life and light <br/>
Hath left me broken-hearted. <br/><br/>

Ah! what is not a dream by day <br/>
To him whose eyes are cast <br/>
On things around him with a ray <br/>
Turned back upon the past? <br/>

That holy dream—that holy dream, <br/>
While all the world were chiding, <br/>
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam <br/>
A lonely spirit guiding. <br/>

What though that light, thro' storm and night, <br/>
So trembled from afar— <br/>
What could there be more purely bright <br/>
In Truth's day-star? <br/>
