<h1>A Psalm of Life</h1>
<h3>BY Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h3>

Tell me not, in mournful numbers, <br/>
   Life is but an empty dream! <br/>
For the soul is dead that slumbers, <br/>
   And things are not what they seem. <br/><br/>

Life is real! Life is earnest! <br/>
   And the grave is not its goal; <br/>
Dust thou art, to dust returnest, <br/>
   Was not spoken of the soul. <br/><br/>

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, <br/>
   Is our destined end or way; <br/>
But to act, that each to-morrow <br/>
   Find us farther than to-day. <br/>

Art is long, and Time is fleeting, <br/>
   And our hearts, though stout and brave, <br/>
Still, like muffled drums, are beating <br/>
   Funeral marches to the grave. <br/><br/>

In the world’s broad field of battle, <br/>
   In the bivouac of Life, <br/>
Be not like dumb, driven cattle! <br/>
   Be a hero in the strife! <br/><br/>

Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant! <br/>
   Let the dead Past bury its dead! <br/>
Act,— act in the living Present! <br/>
   Heart within, and God o’erhead! <br/><br/>

Lives of great men all remind us <br/>
   We can make our lives sublime, <br/>
And, departing, leave behind us <br/>
   Footprints on the sands of time; <br/><br/>

Footprints, that perhaps another, <br/>
   Sailing o’er life’s solemn main, <br/>
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, <br/>
   Seeing, shall take heart again. <br/><br/>

Let us, then, be up and doing, <br/>
   With a heart for any fate; <br/>
Still achieving, still pursuing, <br/>
   Learn to labor and to wait.<br/><br/>
