<h1>To Winter</h1>
<h3>BY William Blake</h3>

O Winter! bar thine adamantine doors: <br/>
The north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark <br/>
Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs <br/>
Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car. <br/><br/>

He hears me not, but o’er the yawning deep <br/>
Rides heavy; his storms are unchain’d, sheathed <br/>
In ribbed steel; I dare not lift mine eyes; <br/>
For he hath rear’d his scepter o’er the world. <br/><br/>

Lo! now the direful monster, whose skin clings <br/>
To his strong bones, strides o’er the groaning rocks: <br/>
He withers all in silence, and in his hand <br/>
Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life. <br/><br/>

He takes his seat upon the cliffs, the mariner <br/>
Cries in vain. Poor little wretch! that deal’st <br/>
With storms; till heaven smiles, and the monster <br/>
Is driven yelling to his caves beneath Mount Hecla. <br/><br/>
