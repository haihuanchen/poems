<h1>Ode to the West Wind</h1>
<h3>BY Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
 
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:<br/>
What if my leaves are falling like its own!<br/>
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies<br/><br/>

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,<br/>
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,<br/>
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!<br/><br/>

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe<br/>
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!<br/>
And, by the incantation of this verse,<br/><br/>

Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth<br/>
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!<br/>
Be through my lips to unawakened Earth<br/><br/>

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,<br/>
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?<br/>
