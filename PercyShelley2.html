<h1>Love's Philosophy</h1>
<h3>BY Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
 
The fountains mingle with the river<br/>
   And the rivers with the ocean,<br/>
The winds of heaven mix for ever<br/>
   With a sweet emotion;<br/>
Nothing in the world is single;<br/>
   All things by a law divine<br/>
In one spirit meet and mingle.<br/>
   Why not I with thine?â€”<br/><br/>

See the mountains kiss high heaven<br/>
   And the waves clasp one another;<br/>
No sister-flower would be forgiven<br/>
   If it disdained its brother;<br/>
And the sunlight clasps the earth<br/>
   And the moonbeams kiss the sea:<br/>
What is all this sweet work worth<br/>
   If thou kiss not me?<br/><br/>
