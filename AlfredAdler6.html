<h1>Manifestation</h1>
<h3>BY Alfred Adler</h3>
  
God who is eternally complete, <br/>
who directs the stars, <br/>
who is the master of fates, <br/>
who elevates man from his lowliness to Himself, <br/>
who speaks from the cosmos to every single human soul, <br/>
is the most brilliant manifestation of the goal of perfection.<br/>
