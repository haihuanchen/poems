<h1>The Hollow Men</h1>
<h3>BY T.S. Eliot</h3>

We are the hollow men<br/>
We are the stuffed men<br/>
Leaning together<br/>
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br/>
Our dried voices, when <br/>
We whisper together<br/>
Are quiet and meaningless<br/>
As wind in dry grass<br/>
or rats' feet over broken glass<br/>
In our dry cellar<br/> <br/>

Shape without form, shade without colour, <br/>
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br/> <br/>

Those who have crossed<br/>
With direct eyes, to death's other kingdom <br/>
Remember us - if at all - not as lost<br/>
Violent souls, but only<br/>
As the hollow men <br/>
The stuffed men. <br/> <br/>
