<h1>What Life Should Be</h1>
<h3>BY Pat A. Fleming</h3>

To learn while still a child <br/>
What this life is meant to be. <br/>
To know it goes beyond myself, <br/>
It's so much more than me. <br/><br/>

To overcome the tragedies, <br/>
To survive the hardest times. <br/>
To face those moments filled with pain, <br/>
And still manage to be kind. <br/><br/>

To fight for those who can't themselves, <br/>
To always share my light. <br/>
With those who wander in the dark, <br/>
To love with all my might. <br/><br/>

To still stand up with courage, <br/>
Though standing on my own. <br/>
To still get up and face each day, <br/>
Even when I feel alone. <br/><br/>

To try to understand the ones <br/>
That no one cares to know. <br/>
And make them feel some value <br/>
When the world has let them go. <br/><br/>

To be an anchor, strong and true, <br/>
That person loyal to the end. <br/>
To be a constant source of hope <br/>
To my family and my friends. <br/><br/>

To live a life of decency, <br/>
To share my heart and soul. <br/>
To always say I'm sorry <br/>
When I've harmed both friend and foe. <br/><br/>

To be proud of whom I've tried to be, <br/>
And this life I chose to live. <br/>
To make the most of every day <br/>
By giving all I have to give. <br/><br/>

To me that's what this life should be, <br/>
To me that's what it's for. <br/>
To take what God has given me <br/>
And make it so much more <br/><br/>

To live a life that matters, <br/>
To be someone of great worth. <br/>
To love and be loved in return <br/>
And make my mark on Earth. <br/><br/>
