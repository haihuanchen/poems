<h1>On the Pulse of Morning</h1>
<h3>BY Maya Angelou</h3>

A Rock, A River, A Tree <br/>
Hosts to species long since departed,  <br/>  
Marked the mastodon, <br/>
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens   <br/> 
Of their sojourn here <br/>
On our planet floor, <br/>
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom    <br/>
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. <br/><br/>

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,   <br/> 
Come, you may stand upon my <br/>
Back and face your distant destiny, <br/>
But seek no haven in my shadow, <br/>
I will give you no hiding place down here. <br/><br/>

You, created only a little lower than <br/>
The angels, have crouched too long in   <br/> 
The bruising darkness <br/>
Have lain too long <br/>
Facedown in ignorance, <br/>
Your mouths spilling words <br/>
Armed for slaughter. <br/><br/>

The Rock cries out to us today,  <br/>  
You may stand upon me,    <br/>
But do not hide your face. <br/><br/>
