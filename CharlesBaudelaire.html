<h1>A Former Life</h1>
<h3>BY Charles Baudelaire</h3>

LONG since, I lived beneath vast porticoes, <br/>
By many ocean-sunsets tinged and fired, <br/>
Where mighty pillars, in majestic rows, <br/>
Seemed like basaltic caves when day expired. <br/><br/>

The rolling surge that mirrored all the skies <br/>
Mingled its music, turbulent and rich, <br/>
Solemn and mystic, with the colours which <br/>
The setting sun reflected in my eyes. <br/><br/>

And there I lived amid voluptuous calms, <br/>
In splendours of blue sky and wandering wave, <br/>
Tended by many a naked, perfumed slave, <br/><br/>

Who fanned my languid brow with waving palms. <br/>
They were my slaves--the only care they had <br/>
To know what secret grief had made me sad. <br/><br/>
