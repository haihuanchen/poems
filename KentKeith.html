    <h1> The Paradoxical Commandments </h1>
    <h3> BY Kent M. Keith </h3>

 People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.<br/>
Love them anyway.<br/><br/>

If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.<br/>
Do good anyway.<br/><br/>

If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.<br/>
Succeed anyway.<br/><br/>

The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.<br/>
Do good anyway.<br/><br/>

Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.<br/>
Be honest and frank anyway.<br/><br/>

The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.<br/>
Think big anyway.<br/><br/>

People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.<br/>
Fight for a few underdogs anyway.<br/><br/>

What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.<br/>
Build anyway.<br/><br/>

People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.<br/>
Help people anyway.<br/><br/>

Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.<br/>
Give the world the best you have anyway.<br/><br/>
