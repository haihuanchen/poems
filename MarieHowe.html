<h1>What the Living Do</h1>
<h3>BY Marie Howe</h3>

Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there. <br/>
And the Drano won't work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up <br/><br/>

waiting for the plumber I still haven't called. This is the everyday we spoke of. <br/>
It's winter again: the sky's a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through <br/><br/>

the open living-room windows because the heat's on too high in here and I can't turn it off. <br/>
For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking, <br/><br/>

I've been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those <br/>
wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve, <br/><br/>

I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it. <br/>
Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning. <br/><br/>

What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want <br/>
whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kissâ€”we want more and more and then more of it. <br/><br/>

But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass, <br/>
say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep <br/><br/>

for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless: <br/>
I am living. I remember you. <br/><br/>
