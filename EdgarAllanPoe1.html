<h1>The Coliseum</h1>
<h3>BY Edgar Allan Poe</h3>

Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary <br/>
Of lofty contemplation left to Time <br/>
By buried centuries of pomp and power! <br/>
At length—at length—after so many days <br/>
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst, <br/>
(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,) <br/>
I kneel, an altered and an humble man, <br/>
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within <br/>
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory! <br/><br/>

Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld! <br/>
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night! <br/>
I feel ye now—I feel ye in your strength— <br/>
O spells more sure than e’er Judaean king <br/>
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane! <br/>
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee <br/>
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars! <br/><br/>

Here, where a hero fell, a column falls! <br/>
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold, <br/>
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat! <br/>
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair <br/>
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle! <br/>
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled, <br/>
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home, <br/>
Lit by the wanlight—wan light of the horned moon, <br/>
The swift and silent lizard of the stones! <br/><br/>

But stay! these walls—these ivy-clad arcades— <br/>
These mouldering plinths—these sad and blackened shafts— <br/>
These vague entablatures—this crumbling frieze— <br/>
These shattered cornices—this wreck—this ruin— <br/>
These stones—alas! these gray stones—are they all— <br/>
All of the famed, and the colossal left <br/>
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me? <br/><br/>

“Not all”—the Echoes answer me—“not all! <br/>
“Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever <br/>
“From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise, <br/>
“As melody from Memnon to the Sun. <br/>
“We rule the hearts of mightiest men—we rule <br/>
“With a despotic sway all giant minds. <br/>
“We are not impotent—we pallid stones. <br/>
“Not all our power is gone—not all our fame— <br/>
“Not all the magic of our high renown— <br/>
“Not all the wonder that encircles us— <br/>
“Not all the mysteries that in us lie— <br/>
“Not all the memories that hang upon <br/>
“And cling around about us as a garment, <br/>
“Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.” <br/><br/>
