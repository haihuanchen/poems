<h1>Hope</h1>
<h3>BY Alice Dunbar-Nelson</h3>

Wild seas of tossing, writhing waves,<br/>
A wreck half sinking in the tortuous gloom;<br/>
One man clings desperately, while Boreas raves,<br/>
And helps to blot the rays of moon and star,<br/>
Then comes a sudden flash of light,<br/>
which gleams on shores afar.<br/>
