<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
<h3>BY Robert Frost</h3>

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br/>
And sorry I could not travel both <br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood <br/>
And looked down one as far as I could <br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br/> <br/>

Then took the other, as just as fair, <br/>
And having perhaps the better claim, <br/>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br/>
Though as for that the passing there <br/>
Had worn them really about the same, <br/> <br/>

And both that morning equally lay <br/>
In leaves no step had trodden black. <br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back. <br/> <br/>

I shall be telling this with a sigh <br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br/>
I took the one less traveled by, <br/>
And that has made all the difference. <br/> <br/>
