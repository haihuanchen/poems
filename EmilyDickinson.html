<h1>Hope is the thing with feathers</h1>
<h3>BY Emily Dickinson</h3>

“Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br/>
That perches in the soul -<br/>
And sings the tune without the words -<br/>
And never stops - at all -<br/><br/>

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br/>
And sore must be the storm -<br/>
That could abash the little Bird<br/>
That kept so many warm -<br/><br/>

I’ve heard it in the chillest land -<br/>
And on the strangest Sea -<br/>
Yet - never - in Extremity,<br/>
It asked a crumb - of me.<br/><br/>
