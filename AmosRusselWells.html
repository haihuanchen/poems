<h1>Hold on a While</h1>
<h3>BY Amos Russel Wells</h3>

When all the sky is very black<br/>
And all the earth is blue,<br/>
And all the fiends are on your track<br/>
And howling after you;<br/><br/>
 
When courage falls and hope decays<br/>
And fair ambition dies,<br/>
And all your dreamland is ablaze<br/>
Beneath the ebon skies;<br/><br/>
When you would fain renounce the goal,<br/>
Nor plod another mile,<br/>
Oh, straighten up your drooping soul,<br/>
And—just—hold on—a while!<br/><br/>
Hold on a while! the darkest night<br/>
May bring the fairest day.<br/>
Hold on a while! the good, the right,<br/>
Will always find a way.<br/><br/>
Hold on! for is Jehovah dead?<br/>
His love an empty song?<br/>
Hold on! have heaven's armies fled<br/>
Before the hosts of wrong?<br/><br/>
Hold on! for still some strength remains,<br/>
Nor yield you till you must;<br/>
A newer life may flood your veins;<br/>
Born of a larger trust.<br/><br/>
A newer life—hold on for that!<br/>
A lily from the mud!<br/>
The greening peak of Ararat<br/>
Emerging from the flood!<br/><br/>
The clouds are shattered by the sun;<br/>
The earth is all aglow;<br/>
Away the howling devils run,<br/>
And back to hell they go!<br/><br/>
Hold on for that! Do what you can,<br/>
Nor prove a craven elf;<br/>
For heaven never helped a man<br/>
Until he helped himself.<br/><br/>
And when your fondest hopes are dead<br/>
And fate has ceased to smile.<br/>
'Tis then it pays to lift your head<br/>
And—just—hold on a-while.<br/><br/>
