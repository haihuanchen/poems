<h1>Song of the Open Road</h1>
<h3>BY Walt Whitman</h3>

Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, <br/>
Healthy, free, the world before me, <br/>
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose. <br/><br/>

Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune, <br/>
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, <br/>
Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms, <br/><br/>
Strong and content I travel the open road. <br/>

The earth, that is sufficient, <br/>
I do not want the constellations any nearer, <br/>
I know they are very well where they are, <br/>
I know they suffice for those who belong to them. <br/><br/>

Still here I carry my old delicious burdens, <br/>
I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go, <br/>
I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, <br/>
I am fillâ€™d with them, and I will fill them in return. <br/><br/>
