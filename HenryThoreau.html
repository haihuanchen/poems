<h1>No Other Life</h1>
<h3>BY Henry David Thoreau</h3>

You must live in the present, <br/>
launch yourself on every wave,<br/>
find your eternity in each moment. <br/>
Fools stand on their island of opportunities and look toward another land. <br/>
There is no other land; <br/>
there is no other life but this.<br/>
