<h1>Because I could not Stop for Death</h1>
<h3>BY Emily Dickinson</h3>

Because I could not stop for Death – <br/>
He kindly stopped for me –   <br/>
The Carriage held but just Ourselves –   <br/>
And Immortality. <br/><br/>

We slowly drove – He knew no haste <br/>
And I had put away <br/>
My labor and my leisure too, <br/>
For His Civility – <br/><br/>

We passed the School, where Children strove <br/>
At Recess – in the Ring –   <br/>
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –  <br/> 
We passed the Setting Sun – <br/><br/>

Or rather – He passed us – <br/>
The Dews drew quivering and chill – <br/>
For only Gossamer, my Gown – <br/>
My Tippet – only Tulle – <br/><br/>

We paused before a House that seemed <br/>
A Swelling of the Ground – <br/>
The Roof was scarcely visible – <br/>
The Cornice – in the Ground – <br/><br/>

Since then – ‘tis Centuries – and yet <br/>
Feels shorter than the Day <br/>
I first surmised the Horses’ Heads <br/>
Were toward Eternity – <br/><br/>
