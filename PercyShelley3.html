<h1>Mont Blanc</h1>
<h3>BY Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
 
The everlasting universe of things <br/>
Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, <br/>
Now dark—now glittering—now reflecting gloom— <br/>
Now lending splendour, where from secret springs <br/>
The source of human thought its tribute brings <br/>
Of waters—with a sound but half its own, <br/>
Such as a feeble brook will oft assume, <br/>
In the wild woods, among the mountains lone, <br/>
Where waterfalls around it leap for ever, <br/>
Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river <br/>
Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves. <br/>
