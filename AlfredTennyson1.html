<h1>The Eagle</h1>
<h3>BY Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>

He clasps the crag with crooked hands;<br/>
Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br/>
Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.<br/><br/>

The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br/>
He watches from his mountain walls,<br/>
And like a thunderbolt he falls.<br/><br/>
