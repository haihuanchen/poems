    <h1> The Human Seasons </h1>
    <h3> BY John Keats </h3>

Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;<br/>
There are four seasons in the mind of man:<br/>
He has his lusty Spring, <br/>
when fancy clear Takes in all beauty with an easy span:<br/>
    He has his Summer, <br/>
    when luxuriously Spring's honeyed cud of youthful thought he loves To ruminate, <br/>
    and by such dreaming high Is nearest unto Heaven: <br/>
    quiet coves His soul has in its Autumn, <br/>
    when his wings He furleth close; <br/>
    contented so to look On mists in idleness—to let fair things Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook:<br/>
    — He has his Winter too of pale misfeature, <br/>
    Or else he would forego his mortal nature.<br/>
