<h1>Boredom</h1>
<h3>BY Soren Kierkegaard</h3>

Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, <br/>
no wonder, then,  <br/>
that the world goes backwards,  <br/>
that evil spreads.  <br/>
This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world.  <br/>
The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings. <br/>
