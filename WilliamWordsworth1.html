<h1>The Sun Has Long Been Set</h1>
<h3>BY William Wordsworth</h3>

The sun has long been set,<br/>
  The stars are out by twos and threes,<br/>
The little birds are piping yet<br/>
  Among the bushes and trees;<br/>
There's a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes,<br/>
And a far-off wind that rushes,<br/>
And a sound of water that gushes,<br/>
And the cuckoo's sovereign cry<br/>
Fills all the hollow of the sky.<br/>
  Who would "go parading"<br/>
In London, "and masquerading,"<br/>
On such a night of June<br/>
With that beautiful soft half-moon,<br/>
And all these innocent blisses?<br/>
On such a night as this is!<br/>
