<h1>Sonnet 17</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

Who will believe my verse in time to come <br/>
If it were filled with your most high deserts? <br/>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb <br/>
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts: <br/>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes, <br/>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces, <br/>
The age to come would say this poet lies, <br/>
Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces. <br/>
So should my papers (yellowed with their age) <br/>
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue, <br/>
And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage, <br/>
And stretched metre of an antique song. <br/>
    But were some child of yours alive that time, <br/>
    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme. <br/>
