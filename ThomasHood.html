<h1>Death</h1>
<h3>BY Thomas Hood</h3>

IT is not death, that sometime in a sigh<br/>
    This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight;<br/>
That sometime these bright stars, that now reply<br/>
    In sunlight to the sun, shall set in night;<br/>
    That this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite,<br/>
And all life's ruddy springs forget to flow;<br/>
    That thoughts shall cease, and the immortal sprite<br/>
Be lapp'd in alien clay and laid below;<br/>
It is not death to know this—but to know<br/>
    That pious thoughts, which visit at new graves<br/>
In tender pilgrimage, will cease to go<br/>
    So duly and so oft—and when grass waves<br/>
Over the pass'd-away, there may be then<br/>
No resurrection in the minds of men.<br/>
