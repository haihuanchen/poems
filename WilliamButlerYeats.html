<h1>The Wild Swans at Coole</h1>
<h3>BY William Butler Yeats</h3>
  
The trees are in their autumn beauty, <br/>
The woodland paths are dry, <br/>
Under the October twilight the water <br/>
Mirrors a still sky; <br/>
Upon the brimming water among the stones <br/>
Are nine-and-fifty swans. <br/><br/>

The nineteenth autumn has come upon me <br/>
Since I first made my count; <br/>
I saw, before I had well finished, <br/>
All suddenly mount <br/>
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings <br/>
Upon their clamorous wings. <br/><br/>

I have looked upon those brilliant creatures, <br/>
And now my heart is sore. <br/>
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight, <br/>
The first time on this shore, <br/>
The bell-beat of their wings above my head, <br/>
Trod with a lighter tread. <br/><br/>

Unwearied still, lover by lover, <br/>
They paddle in the cold <br/>
Companionable streams or climb the air; <br/>
Their hearts have not grown old; <br/>
Passion or conquest, wander where they will, <br/>
Attend upon them still. <br/><br/>

But now they drift on the still water, <br/>
Mysterious, beautiful; <br/>
Among what rushes will they build, <br/>
By what lake's edge or pool <br/>
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day <br/>
To find they have flown away? <br/><br/>
