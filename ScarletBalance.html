<h1>Reflection</h1>
<h3>BY Scarlet Balance</h3>

To chase my dreams, I'll carry on living.<br/>
But I will always remember, the pain that I'm feeling.<br/>
I can't stay back now, I have to go on forward.<br/>
But something is limiting.<br/>
I must move on now, breaking these bonds that hold me back.<br/>
