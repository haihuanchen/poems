<h1>Busy Life</h1>
<h3>BY Unknown</h3>

I’m busy;<br/>
but not in the way<br/>
most people accept.<br/>
I’m busy calming my fear<br/>
and finding my courage.<br/>
I’m busy listening to my kids.<br/>
I’m busy getting in touch<br/>
with what is real.<br/>
I’m busy growing things and<br/>
connecting with the natural world.<br/>
I’m busy questioning my answers.<br/>
I’m busy being present in my life.<br/>
