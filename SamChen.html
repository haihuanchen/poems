<h1>Two Worlds</h1>
<h3>BY Sam Chen</h3>

You are the day, I am the night.<br/>
We will never meet each other.<br/>
You are the dusk, I am the dawn.<br/>
We will never see each other.<br/>
You are the fire, I am the ice,<br/>
We will never embrace each other.<br/><br/>

The memory you gave eventually dissolved,<br/>
Like the shadow of yours disappearing in sunset.<br/>
Your voice turned fuzzy,<br/>
Like the maple leaves falling from trees,<br/>
Fading away little by little.<br/>
The missing you gave was melted away.<br/>
Like the whispering of summer wind,<br/>
Passing away wisp by wisp.<br/><br/>

I rehearse your promise in my mind,<br/>
I recite your poems in my heart,<br/>
I decorate your landscape in my mind,<br/>
I sprinkled your dream in my heart.<br/><br/>
