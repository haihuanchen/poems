<h1>My Sad Self</h1>
<h3>BY Allen Ginsberg</h3>

Sometimes when my eyes are red <br/>
I go up on top of the RCA Building <br/>
and gaze at my world, Manhattan— <br/>
my buildings, streets I’ve done feats in, <br/>
lofts, beds, coldwater flats <br/>
—on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind, <br/>
its ant cars, little yellow taxis,  <br/>
men walking the size of specks of wool— <br/>
Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine, <br/>
sun go down over New Jersey where I was born <br/>
Paterson where I played with ants— <br/>
my later loves on 15th Street, <br/>
my greater loves of Lower East Side, <br/>
my once fabulous amours in the Bronx faraway— <br/>
paths crossing in these hidden streets, <br/>
my history summed up, my absences    <br/>
and ecstasies in Harlem— <br/>
—sun shining down on all I own <br/>
in one eyeblink to the horizon <br/>
in my last eternity— <br/>
matter is water. <br/>
