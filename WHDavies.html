<h1>Leisure</h1>
<h3>BY W. H. Davies</h3>

What is this life if, full of care, <br/>
We have no time to stand and stare. <br/><br/>

No time to stand beneath the boughs <br/>
And stare as long as sheep or cows. <br/><br/>

No time to see, when woods we pass, <br/>
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass. <br/><br/>

No time to see, in broad daylight, <br/>
Streams full of stars, like skies at night. <br/><br/>

No time to turn at Beautyâ€™s glance, <br/>
And watch her feet, how they can dance. <br/><br/>

No time to wait till her mouth can <br/>
Enrich that smile her eyes began. <br/><br/>

A poor life this if, full of care, <br/>
We have no time to stand and stare. <br/><br/>
