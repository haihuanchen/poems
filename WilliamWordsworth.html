<h1>A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal</h1>
<h3>BY William Wordsworth</h3>

A slumber did my spirit seal;<br/>
   I had no human fears:<br/>
She seemed a thing that could not feel<br/>
   The touch of earthly years.<br/><br/>

No motion has she now, no force;<br/>
   She neither hears nor sees;<br/>
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,<br/>
   With rocks, and stones, and trees.<br/><br/>
