<h1>Sonnet 66</h1>
<h3>BY William Shakespeare</h3>

Tired of all these, for restful death I cry,<br/>
As to behold desert a beggar born,<br/>
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,<br/>
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br/>
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,<br/>
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br/>
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,<br/>
And strength by limping sway disabled,<br/>
And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br/>
And folly-doctor-like-controlling skill,<br/>
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,<br/>
And captive good attending captain ill:<br/>
Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,<br/>
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.<br/>
