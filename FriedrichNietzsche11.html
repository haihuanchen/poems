<h1>God is Dead</h1>
<h3>BY Friedrich Nietzsche</h3>

God is dead. <br/>
God remains dead. <br/>
And we have killed him. <br/>
Yet his shadow still looms. <br/>
How shall we comfort ourselves, <br/>
the murderers of all murderers? <br/>
What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives; <br/>
who will wipe this blood off us?  <br/>
What water is there for us to clean ourselves?<br/>
