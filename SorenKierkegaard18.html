<h1>Travel</h1>
<h3>BY Soren Kierkegaard</h3>

People commonly travel the world over to see <br/>
rivers and mountains, <br/>
new stars, <br/>
garish birds, <br/>
freak fish, <br/>
grotesque breeds of human; <br/>
they fall into an animal stupor that gapes at existence and they think they have seen something. <br/>
