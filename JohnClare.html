<h1>I Love to See the Summer Beaming Forth</h1>
<h3>BY John Clare</h3>

I love to see the summer beaming forth<br/>
And white wool sack clouds sailing to the north<br/><br/>
  
I love to see the wild flowers come again<br/>
And mare blobs stain with gold the meadow drain<br/>
And water lilies whiten on the floods<br/><br/>

Where reed clumps rustle like a wind shook wood<br/>
Where from her hiding place the Moor Hen pushes<br/>
And seeks her flag nest floating in bull rushes<br/><br/>

I like the willow leaning half way oâ€™er<br/>
The clear deep lake to stand upon its shore<br/><br/>

I love the hay grass when the flower head swings<br/>
To summer winds and insects happy wings<br/>
That sport about the meadow the bright day<br/>
And see bright beetles in the clear lake play<br/>
