<h1>The Splendor Falls</h1>
<h3>BY Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>

The splendor falls on castle walls<br/>
    And snowy summits old in story;<br/>
The long light shakes across the lakes,<br/>
    And the wild cataract leaps in glory.<br/>
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,<br/>
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.<br/><br/>

O, hark, O, hear! how thin and clear,<br/>
    And thinner, clearer, farther going!<br/>
O, sweet and far from cliff and scar<br/>
    The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!<br/>
Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying,<br/>
Blow, bugles; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.<br/><br/>

O love, they die in yon rich sky,<br/>
    They faint on hill or field or river;<br/>
Our echoes roll from soul to soul,<br/>
    And grow forever and forever.<br/>
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,<br/>
And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.<br/><br/>
