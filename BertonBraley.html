<h1>Opportunity</h1>
<h3>BY Berton Braley</h3>

With doubt and dismay you are smitten<br/>
You think there’s no chance for you, son?<br/>
Why, the best books haven’t been written,<br/>
The best race hasn’t been run,<br/><br/>

The best score hasn’t been made yet,<br/>
The best song hasn’t been sung,<br/>
The best tune hasn’t been played yet,<br/>
Cheer up, for the world is young!<br/><br/>

No chance? Why the world is just eager<br/>
For things that you ought to create,<br/>
It’s store of true wealth is still meager,<br/>
It’s needs are incessant and great,<br/><br/>

It yearns for more power and beauty,<br/>
More laughter and love and romance,<br/>
More loyalty, labor and duty,<br/>
No chance–why there’s nothing but chance!<br/><br/>

For the best verse hasn’t been rhymed yet,<br/>
The best house hasn’t been planned,<br/>
The highest peak hasn’t been climbed yet,<br/>
The mightiest rivers aren’t spanned,<br/><br/>

Don’t worry and fret, faint hearted,<br/>
The chances have just begun,<br/>
For the best jobs haven’t been started,<br/>
The best work hasn’t been done.<br/><br/>
