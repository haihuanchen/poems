<h1>Fate</h1>
<h3>BY Ralph Waldo Emerson</h3>

That you are fair or wise is vain,<br/>
Or strong, or rich, or generous;<br/>
You must have also the untaught strain<br/>
That sheds beauty on the rose.<br/>
There is a melody born of melody,<br/>
Which melts the world into a sea:<br/>
Toil could never compass it;<br/>
Art its height could never hit;<br/>
It came never out of wit;<br/>
But a music music-born<br/>
Well may Jove and Juno scorn.<br/>
Thy beauty, if it lack the fire<br/>
Which drives me mad with sweet desire,<br/>
What boots it? what the soldier's mail,<br/>
Unless he conquer and prevail?<br/>
What all the goods thy pride which lift,<br/>
If thou pine for another's gift?<br/>
Alas! that one is born in blight,<br/>
Victim of perpetual slight:<br/>
When thou lookest on his face,<br/>
Thy heart saith, "Brother, go thy ways!<br/>
None shall ask thee what thou doest,<br/>
Or care a rush for what thou knowest,<br/>
Or listen when thou repliest,<br/>
Or remember where thou liest,<br/>
Or how thy supper is sodden;"<br/>
And another is born<br/>
To make the sun forgotten.<br/>
Surely he carries a talisman<br/>
Under his tongue;<br/>
Broad are his shoulders, and strong;<br/>
And his eye is scornful,<br/>
Threatening, and young.<br/>
I hold it of little matter<br/>
Whether your jewel be of pure water,<br/>
A rose diamond or a white,<br/>
But whether it dazzle me with light.<br/>
I care not how you are dressed,<br/>
In the coarsest or in the best;<br/>
Nor whether your name is base or brave;<br/>
Nor for the fashion of your behavior;<br/>
But whether you charm me,<br/>
Bid my bread feed and my fire warm me,<br/>
And dress up Nature in your favor.<br/>
One thing is forever good;<br/>
That one thing is Success, â€”<br/>
Dear to the Eumenides,<br/>
And to all the heavenly brood.<br/>
Who bides at home, nor looks abroad,<br/>
Carries the eagles, and masters the sword.<br/>
