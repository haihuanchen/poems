<h1>No Man Is An Island</h1>
<h3>BY John Donne</h3>

No man is an island, <br/>
Entire of itself, <br/>
Every man is a piece of the continent, <br/>
A part of the main. <br/>
If a clod be washed away by the sea, <br/>
Europe is the less. <br/>
As well as if a promontory were. <br/>
As well as if a manor of thy friend’s <br/>
Or of thine own were: <br/>
Any man’s death diminishes me, <br/>
Because I am involved in mankind, <br/>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br/>
It tolls for thee. <br/>
